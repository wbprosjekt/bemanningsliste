# Codex Prompt: Refusjon Hjemmelading - Reference Check

## Context
We've implemented a complete "Refusjon hjemmelading" (Home Charging Reimbursement) module for FieldNote.no. The module is ~98% complete but has some TypeScript build errors related to database type definitions.

## What We Built
- Complete database schema (`supabase/migrations/20250130000000_create_refusjon_hjemmelading_module.sql`)
- CSV parsing, time-splitting, pricing engine
- PDF/CSV report generation
- All API routes for CSV workflow
- Admin and employee UI pages
- Price history chart on refusjon page

## Current Problem
TypeScript build is failing because Supabase's generated types don't include the new `ref_*` tables. We've already:
1. ✅ Regenerated TypeScript types: `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id jlndohflirfixbinqdwe > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
2. ✅ Added `as any` casts throughout the code to work around type issues
3. ⚠️ Still getting 1-2 remaining type errors

## Build Error Details
```
Type error: Property 'id' does not exist on type 'SelectQueryError<"Invalid Relationships..."'
```

Error location: `src/app/api/admin/refusjon/csv/generer/route.ts` around line 54

## Files to Check
1. `src/app/api/admin/refusjon/csv/generer/route.ts` - Check line 54 area for settings access
2. `src/app/api/admin/refusjon/csv/analyser/route.ts` - Verify all `as any` casts are correct
3. Any other TypeScript errors in the refusjon API routes

## Task
Fix the remaining TypeScript build errors in the refusjon module. Use `as any` casts where necessary since the generated types might not be perfect yet.

## Key Context
- The `ref_*` tables exist in Supabase database
- We've regenerated types once already
- We're using `as any` liberally to bypass type checking issues
- Focus on making the build pass, type safety can be improved later

## Expected Outcome
- Build succeeds: `npm run build` completes without TypeScript errors
- Dev server starts: `npm run dev` works
- All refusjon API routes compile successfully

Fix the errors and provide a summary of what was changed.
